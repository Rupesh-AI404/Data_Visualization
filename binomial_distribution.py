# Binomial Distribution
# It describes the outcome of binary scenarios, e.g. toss of a coin, it will either be head or tails.

# It has three parameters:

# n - number of trials.

# p - probability of occurrence of each trial (e.g. for toss of a coin 0.5 each).

# size - The shape of the returned array.
